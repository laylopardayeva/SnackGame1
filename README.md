# Snake Game

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, built entirely in Java. It is one of my initial projects, aimed at practicing and demonstrating basic Java programming skills. In this game, players control a snake to eat items on the screen while avoiding walls and its own growing tail.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The sole technology used to develop the game, leveraging basic Java libraries for GUI and game logic.

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Control the snake to eat items and grow in length.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of how much the snake eats and display the score.
- **End Game Mechanics**: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or itself.
